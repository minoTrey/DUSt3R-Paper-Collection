# Medical and Specialized Applications

## üè• Overview

The Medical and Specialized Applications category showcases adaptations of DUSt3R for domain-specific challenges, particularly in medical imaging and endoscopy. These papers address unique constraints such as dynamic deformable tissues, limited texture, challenging lighting conditions, and the need for real-time performance in surgical settings.

## üìà Research Focus

```
Medical adaptations address:
- Monocular endoscopic video reconstruction
- Dynamic surgical scenes with deformable tissues
- Real-time requirements for intraoperative guidance
- Scale-consistent depth without calibration
```

## üéØ Key Challenges in Medical Domain

1. **Dynamic Deformation**: Tissues and organs constantly move and deform
2. **Limited Texture**: Biological surfaces often lack distinctive features
3. **Challenging Lighting**: Specular reflections and uneven illumination
4. **No Ground Truth**: Difficult to obtain accurate 3D labels in vivo
5. **Real-time Requirements**: Surgery demands immediate feedback

## üìä Medical-Specific Innovations

### Adaptation Strategies
| Challenge | Solution | Impact |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Dynamic scenes | Dual memory mechanism | Temporal consistency |
| No calibration | Self-supervised learning | Practical deployment |
| Deformable tissues | Uncertainty-aware filtering | Robust reconstruction |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start with Endo3R
```python
# Installation
pip install endo3r torch torchvision

# Basic usage for endoscopic video
from endo3r import Endo3R
import cv2

# Initialize model
model = Endo3R.from_pretrained("medical/Endo3R_EndoSLAM")

# Process endoscopic video
video_path = 'endoscopy_video.mp4'
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

frames = []
while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    frames.append(frame)

# Reconstruct with uncertainty filtering
results = model.process_surgical_video(
    frames,
    filter_uncertainty=True,
    maintain_scale=True
)

# Extract outputs
depth_maps = results['depth']  # Per-frame depth
pointclouds = results['points3d']  # 3D reconstruction
uncertainty = results['uncertainty']  # Confidence maps
```

## üîÆ Future Directions
- Multi-modal fusion (RGB + other sensors)
- AR overlay for surgical guidance
- Instrument tracking and recognition
- Tissue classification integration
- More medical imaging domains (ultrasound, CT, MRI)
